⚡ Fun Fact: Did you know that the term "computer bug" was actually inspired by a real insect? In 1947, computer pioneer Grace Hopper discovered a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. Since then, software errors have been called "bugs" – a fascinating origin for a term that's now an integral part of the IT world!
